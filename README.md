# Nexus_Sharing
This is Nexus_Sharing, a site I made for my CSC317 course. It allows users to create an account, upload a photo, leave a comment  and view other people's post. There are a some features that need to be fixed, such as the search which doesn't display results correctly and they contain broken links.
